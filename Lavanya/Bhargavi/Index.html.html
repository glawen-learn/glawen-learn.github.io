<h1 style="color:red;text-align:center;">Tourist Places In India</h1><br>
<h2 class="center">1.The Holy City of Varanasi</h2>
<img src="varanasi.jpg" alt="Varanasi" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p>A major pilgrimage center for Hindus,the holy city of Varanasi has long been associated with the mighty Ganges River, one of the faith's most important religious symbols. Dating back to the 8th century BC, Varanasi is one of the oldest still inhabited cities in the world.</p><br>
<h2 class="center">2. Harmandir Sahib: The Golden Temple of Amritsar</h2>
<img src="golden temple.jpg" alt="Golden temple" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p> Founded in 1577 by Ram Das,Amritsar is an important hub of Sikh history and culture. The main attraction here is Harmandir Sahib, opened in 1604 and still often referred to as the Golden Temple for its beautiful gold decoration. The holiest of india's many Sikh shrines(it also attracts many Hindus and people of other faiths"), the temple was built in a blend of Hindu and Islamic styles, its lower marble section featuring such flourishes as ornate inlaid floral and animal motifs, while the large golden dome represents a lotus flower, a symbol of purity to sikhs.</p><br>
<h2 class="center">3. The Golden City:Jaisalmer</h2>
<img src="jaisalmer.jpg" alt="Jaisalmer" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p>So named for the yellow sandstone used in most of its building, the Golden City of Jaisalmer is an oasis of splendid old architecture that rises from the sand dunes of the Thar Desert. Once a strategic outpost, today the city is filled with splendid old mansions, magnificent gateways, and the massive Jaisalmer Fort-also known as the Golden Fort-a daunting 12th-century structure that rises high above the town.</p><br>
<h2 class="center">4. The Red Fort, New Delhi</h2>
<img src="new delhi.jpg" alt="New delhi" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p>Built by Shah Jahan in 1648 as the seat of Mughal power-a role it maintained until 1857-the magnificent crescent-shaped Red Fort in New Delhi, named after the stunning red sandstone used in its construction, covers a vast area of more than two square kilometers, all of it surrounded by a large moat. Highlights include its two largest gates: the impressive Lahore Gate (the fort's main entrance) and the elaborately decorated Delhi Gate, once used by the emperor for ceremonial processions.</P><br>
<h2 class="center">5. Mumbai: The Gateway of India</h2>
<img src="mumbai.jpg" alt="Gateway" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p> Standing an impressive 26 meters tall and overlooking the Arabian Sea, the iconic Gateway of India is a must-see when in Mumbai. Built to commemorate the arrival of King George V and his wife Queen Mary in 1911, this stunning piece of architecture was opened with much pomp and ceremony in 1924 and was, for a while, the tallest structure in the city.</p><br>
<h2 class="center">6. Mecca Masjid, Hyderabad</h2>
<img src="mecca masjid.jpg" alt="Hyderabad" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p>Construction of Hyderabad's Mecca Masjid, one of the world's largest mosques-and one of the oldest in India-began in 1614 during Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah's reign and took almost 80 years to complete. Large enough to accommodate 10,000 worshipers, this beautiful mosque's 15 enormous arches and pillars were each wrought from single slabs of black granite dragged to the site by huge cattle trains reputedly consisting of up to 1,400 bulls.</p><br>
<h2 class="center">7. Amer Fort, Jaipur</h2>
<img src="jaipur.jpg" alt="Amer Fort" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p> Amer Fort (often also spelt "Amber") was built as a fortified palace in 1592 by Maharaja Man Singh I and has long served as the capital of Jaipur. Carved high up into the hillside, the fort is accessible on foot via a steep climb or by shuttle rides from the town below (better still, let an elephant do the work). Highlights include Jaleb Chowk, the first courtyard, with its many decorated elephants, and the Shila Devi Temple, dedicated to the goddess of war. Also of note is the adjoining Hall of Public Audience (Diwan-i-Am) with its finely decorated walls and terraces frequented by monkeys.</p><br>
<h2 class="center">8. The Beaches of Goa</h2>
<img src="goa.jpg" alt="Beaches of goa" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p>Long known within India as the "go-to" destination for those seeking a great beach holiday, Goa's beautiful western coastline, overlooking the Arabian Sea, has only recently been discovered by tourists from overseas.

Goa's more than 60 miles of coastline is home to some of the world's loveliest beaches, each with their own particular appeal. For those looking for peace and quiet, isolated Agonda Beach is a good choice, while Calangute Beach is by far the most commercial and crowded.</p><br>
<h2 class="center">9. Periyar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary, Madurai</h2>
<img src="madurai.jpg" alt="National park" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p>One of South India's most popular tourist attractions, Periyar National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary is centered around a lake built by British engineers in 1895 for irrigation and to provide water to the city of Madurai. Established in 1934, this beautiful park is home to numerous species of mammals, including a large free-roaming Indian elephant population, wild boar, otters, the lion-tailed macaque, and more than 20 Bengal tigers. Bird watching is a popular activity with frequent sightings of species such as darters, storks, kingfishers, hornbills, and racket-tailed drongos, along with many interesting varieties of butterflies.</p><br>
<h2 class="center">10. Agra Fort</h2>
<img src="agra fort.jpg" alt="agra fort" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p>Built as a military structure in 1565 by Emperor Akbar with later additions by Shah Jahan, the stunning Agra Fort (also known as Agra's Red Fort) is an interesting mix of both Hindu and Muslim influences. Located a little more than two kilometers from the Taj Mahal, the fort is entered through Amar Singh Gate with its low outer wall and dogleg design built to confuse attackers. Once inside, you'll see two large interlinked sandstone buildings, Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal, the largest private residence in the complex.</p><br>
<h2 class="center">11. The Ellora Caves, Aurangabad</h2>
<img src="aurangabad.jpg" alt="Ellora Caves" style="width:1300px; height:600px;">
<p>The famous monumental Ellora Caves were built between the 5th and 10th centuries by Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu monks, and make for an excellent excursion from Mumbai, some 300 kilometers to the west.

Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this remarkable collection of 34 carved monasteries, chapels, and temples-12 of them Buddhist, 17 Hindu, and five belonging to the Jain faith-were built in close proximity to each other, a reflection of the religious tolerance that existed during this period of Indian history.</p><br>
<h2 class="center">12. Mehrangarh Fort, Jodhpur</h2>
<img src="jodhpur.jpg" alt="Mehrangarh" style="width:1340px; height:600px;">
<p>Dominating the old city of Jodhpur, the massive Mehrangarh Fort, one of the largest fortifications in India, was built in the 15th century to safeguard the people of the famous "Blue City," as Jodhpur is still known - a name derived from its indigo colored houses, painted blue to deflect the heat.

Built on top of a towering outcrop, Mehrangarh is an amazing feat of construction, its massive walls all but impenetrable. Access is via one of seven splendid gates, including Jaya Pol and Fateh Pol (the latter still bears scars from cannon attacks).</p>
